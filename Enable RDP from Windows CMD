Activating RDP via the Windows CMD (Command Prompt) is useful when automating RDP setups across multiple Windows machines or creating scripts to streamline the configuration process.

1. Type cmd in the Windows search box.

2. Select Run as administrator to open the Command Prompt with administrative privileges.

3. The reg command is used to modify the Windows Registry. Enter the following command to enable RDP:
reg add "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server" /v fDenyTSConnections /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f

4. (Optional) If the Windows Firewall is activated, use the following command to enable RDP connections:
netsh advfirewall firewall set rule group="remote desktop" new enable=Yes

The Windows system is ready to accept RDP connections.
